## Dataset Content
Images are encoded to HEIF (.heic) to minimize storage requirement.
We recommend directly reading the image as is using library such as [pyheif](https://pypi.org/project/pyheif/).  

### Folder/Filename Convension
After uncompressing the zip, you will find *patch folders* named `S{}_P{}_{product_name}_{handiness}`.  
- `S` stands for subject number, i.e., all `S1` folders come from the same person;
- `P` stands for patch number, i.e., all `S1_P1` folders come from the exact same skin patch;
- `product_name` refers to the product applied onto the skin patch, and
- `handiness` refers to which hand the patch comes from.

In each of the *patch folders*, we have subfolders `1~8`, the number refers to the number of LED light that is lit during the capture.  
All images are named `calibration_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}_{}.heic`, 
Each of the 3 digit numbers refer to the intensity of the LED light (0~200). 
The lighting condition are randomized amoung subjects, but consistent for all patches for the same subject across all patches. 
The relative position of the LED light with regard to the camera is fixed.
